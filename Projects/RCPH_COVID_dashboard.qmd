# Background  

One of Nicole's first tasks when hired as Routt County Public Health's Epidemiologist/Data Manager in September 2020 was to redesign and improve the existing COVID-19 dashbaord used by the county. The requirements for this dashboard, based upon feedback from policy makers and department staff, were  

1. provide locally-relevant, comprehensive surveillance data  
2. use thresholds and categories that are consistent with those used by the State of Colorado  
3. ensure reproducibility of analysis and adaptability of tools to accommodate changing data and changing questions   

Nicole led all development and enhancements of this project through May 2022 when she left her position with Routt County. The dashboard continues to be published but development and enhancements have stopped.
