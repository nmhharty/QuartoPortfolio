# Background

WellPower (formerly the Mental Health Center of Denver) hosts an Innovation Week within the Information Systems department each year. This is a week where the department takes a pause from regular projects and focused resources on innovative, proof of concept projects with the aim to bring them into production by the end of the week. In 2019, I pitched a project to recruit department members to support me in developing a template R Markdown file to be used by any of my evaluation and research team colleagues.

I was the first staff person at WellPower to use R Markdown for reproducible, semi-automated reporting beginning in early 2019. However, I had not had the opportunity to dig into the full power of this tool. I used Innovation Week to build a more sustainable approach to using R Markdown and to teach my evaluation and research team colleagues how to use the template.
